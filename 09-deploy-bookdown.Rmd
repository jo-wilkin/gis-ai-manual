# Deploying R Bookdown on Posit Connect Cloud

You've done the analysis. You've got clean data, solid results, and a collection of scripts that do exactly what you need. Now what? For many GIS projects, the answer is: make it accessible to others. This chapter covers deploying an R Bookdown document — like a technical report, methodology guide, or data documentation — to Posit Connect Cloud so anyone with the link can read it.

If this sounds like a big jump from writing R scripts, don't worry. Claude Code handles most of the configuration, and Posit Connect Cloud takes care of the hosting.

## What is Bookdown?

- **Bookdown is an R package** that turns a collection of R Markdown files into a structured, navigable book — as HTML, PDF, or both.
- **You're reading one right now.** This guide is built with Bookdown.
- **It's ideal for GIS documentation** — technical reports, methodology documents, data dictionaries, and training materials that combine text, code, and figures.
- **Each chapter is a separate `.Rmd` file**, which keeps things manageable and makes collaboration easier.

## What is Posit Connect Cloud?

- **Posit Connect Cloud** (formerly RStudio Connect Cloud) is a hosting platform for R and Python content — Shiny apps, Bookdown documents, Quarto sites, and more.
- **Free tier available.** You can publish up to 5 pieces of content for free, which is plenty for most individual projects.
- **No server management.** You publish from your machine; Posit handles the hosting, rendering, and access control.
- **Shareable via URL.** Once published, anyone with the link can access your document — useful for sharing results with stakeholders who don't use R.

## Setting Up a Bookdown Project with Claude

Ask Claude to scaffold the project structure for you:

> *"Create a Bookdown project structure for a technical report on our green space accessibility analysis. Include an index file, three content chapters, a references file, and the necessary configuration files."*

Claude will generate:

- `index.Rmd` — the title page and preface
- `01-data.Rmd`, `02-methods.Rmd`, `03-results.Rmd` — your content chapters
- `_bookdown.yml` — configuration for chapter ordering and output
- `_output.yml` — output format settings
- `style.css` — optional custom styling

## Building Locally

Before deploying, build the book on your machine to check everything renders correctly:

> *"Build the bookdown site and open it in the browser."*

Claude will run:
```r
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::gitbook")
```

Check the output in your browser. Look for:

- Do all chapters appear in the table of contents?
- Do figures and maps render correctly?
- Are code chunks displaying as intended (or hidden, if that's what you want)?
- Do cross-references and links work?

## Deploying to Posit Connect Cloud

1. **Create a Posit Connect Cloud account** at [connect.posit.cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud) if you don't have one.

2. **Install the rsconnect package** if needed:
```r
install.packages("rsconnect")
```

3. **Configure your account** — Posit Connect Cloud will give you an API key. Ask Claude:
> *"Help me configure rsconnect to publish to Posit Connect Cloud."*

4. **Publish:**
> *"Deploy this bookdown project to Posit Connect Cloud."*

Claude will guide you through the `rsconnect::deployDoc()` or `rsconnect::deploySite()` process, handling the configuration details.

## Updating Your Deployed Document

One of the best things about this workflow: updating is trivial.

- Make your changes locally (ideally on a branch, as per Chapter 4).
- Rebuild the book.
- Re-deploy with the same command — it updates the existing publication rather than creating a new one.
- **Ask Claude:** *"Rebuild the bookdown site and redeploy to Posit Connect Cloud."*

Your URL stays the same, so anyone who has the link will see the latest version.
